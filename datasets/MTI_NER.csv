miR-206,notch3,"In addition, suppression of the notch3 3'-UTR by miR-206 was relieved by deletion (Fig.1B, right) or mutation (supplemental Fig.S2A) of the miR-206-binding site and was markedly recovered by a specific miR-206 inhibitor (Fig.1C) whose function is to block the cleavage of precursor miR-206 to mature miR-206 (21)."

miR-183,FOXO1,"Results showed a dosedependent decrease in FOXO1 transcripts in human ONS-76 cells transfectedwith pre-miR-183 (Fig.3A), but no significant changes in FOXO1 levels in similarly treated mouse C17-2 cells (Fig.3B)."
miR-183,FOXO1,"Western blot for FOXO1 protein levels following miR-183 transfection was consistent with this; there was decreased FOXO1 protein levels in miR-183 transfected ONS-76 cells (Fig.3C),"
miR-9,OC1,Expression of miR-9 had no effect on luciferase expression when OC1 target sites were absent from the 30UTR of the pGL3 vector (Fig.4B).
miR-155,MXI1,"Because two target sites for miR-155 exist in the MXI1 39UTR (one was predicted by miRanda, and the other by microRNA.org), we divided the MXI1 39UTR into two fragments, MXI1-39UTR1 and MXI1-39UTR2; each fragment contains one target site."
MiR-10b,HOXD10 39UTR,"MiR-10b overexpression remarkably reduced luciferase activity of reporter gene with wild-type, but not mutant HOXD10 39UTR, indicating that miR-10b directly targeted HOXD10 39UTR."

miR-126,Sox2,"As expected, significant repression of luciferase activities were observed in MG-63 cells co-transfected with pGL3-Sox2 3'-UTR vector and miR-126 mimic compared to mutant constructs groups."
miR-126,Sox2,"Each single mutant construct, MUT-1 and MUT-2, exhibited a lower inhibitory effect on luciferase activity compared with the pGL3-Sox2 3'-UTR vector after miR-126 co-transfection, and the double mutant construct, MUT-12, showed complete reversal of inhibitory effect of miR-126 co-transfection (Figure 3B), suggesting that miR-126 suppressed the transcription activity of the Sox2 gene by targeting the two binding sites in the 3'UTR of Sox2 mRNA independently."
miR-214,Rab15,"To test this, we overexpressed miR-214 in Huh-7 cells by infection with lenti-pri-miR-214 lentiviruses, which resulted in a decrease of the level of Rab15 protein (Fig.5F, left panel)."

let-7f,HDAC2,"In let-7f over-expressing cells, expression of HDAC2 mRNA and protein was reduced, whereas knockdown of let-7f increased HDAC2 expression (Fig.11b,c)."
let-7f,HDAC2,These results indicated that HDAC2 is a target of let-7f.
miR-503,ARHGEF19,"As shown in Figure 3C, luciferase activity of ARHGEF19 30UTR reporter in LV-miR-503 HCCLM3 cells decreased significantly as compared with in LV-control HCCLM3 cells (P < 0.01)."

miR-940,RIP1,"Using quantitative PCR, we confirmed that miR-940 was increased in RIP1 knockdown cells (Fig.5A)."
miR-216b,Beclin1,"The luciferase activity of Beclin1 wild-type 30UTR construct was dramatically decreased down to w49.2% by the transfection of miR-216b, and such decrease was abrogated by mutating one predicted binding site (Mut1, 290e295) in the Beclin1 30UTR."
miR-196a2,TYMS,"Although no statistical difference was presented between TYMS reporter plasmid and miR-196a2 C/T expression plasmids, the luciferase expression was lower in pPG-miR-196a2-C than in pPG-miR-196a2-T."

miR-376a,Pcna,We constructed dual-luciferase reporter vectors by inserting the DNA sequence encoding the WT or mutant (which cannot bind miR-376a) 30 UTR of Pcna mRNA downstream the Renilla luciferase gene (Fig.1D) and transfected them with miR-376a mimics into 293T cells respectively.
miR-101-3p,Rap1b,"Wild-type Rap1b 3=-UTR luciferase activity could be reduced by miR-101-3p, compared with the control."
miR-101-3p,Rap1b,And miR-101-3p had a light effect on the mutated Rap1b 3=-UTR1 (one site mutation) and had no effect on the mutated Rap1b 3=-UTR 2 (two sites mutation) luciferase activity (Figs.
miR-101-3p,Rap1b,"5B and 5C), indicating that miR-101-3p inhibited Rap1b gene expression in a position-dependent manner."
miR-202,LRP6,"As predicted, western blotting showed that LRP6 expression was downregulated by ectopic miR-202 and upregulated by miR-202 inhibitor in both QGY-7703 and HepG2 cells (Fig.4B)."

miR-483-5p,SRF,We identified that serum response factor (SRF) is one of miR-483-5p target genes.
miR-92a,MKK4,"In contrast, miR-92a overexpression did not significantly reduce the luciferase activity of the wild-type MKK4 construct (site1) (Fig.4b)."
miR-9,HDAC4,To confirm that this inhibition is partially regulated by miR-9 the HDAC4 39UTR plasmid was co-transfected with expression vectors for miR-9 (cloned into pSI and/or Block-it) into HeLa cells.
miR-9,HDAC4,Data from these assays indicate that miR-9 is capable of targeting the HDAC4 39UTR (Fig.4C).
miR-138,ICP0,"To test whether miR-138 can repress ICP0 expression, we transfected a miR- 138 mimic or a variant mimic bearing three nucleotide changes in the seed region (miR-M138; Figure 1C) together with an ICP0 expression plasmid."
miR-138,ICP0,"Taken together, these results show that miR-138 can repress ICP0 expression through its target sites in ICP0 mRNA in a seed region-dependent manner."
miR-200c,IL8,"As shown in Fig.1D, luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-200c has limited or no interaction with IL8 39UTR, suggesting that the regulatory function of miR-200c on IL8 expression, at least in LSMC, occurs through other mechanism(s)."
miR-96,TERF2IP,"Expression increases in miR-96 from post- to 60 min post-exercise (fold change = 2.11, P,0.01) also paralleled simultaneous downregulation in TERF2IP mRNA expression (fold change =0.54, P, 0.01) (Table S7)."

miR-193b,NF1,"This effect was completely abrogated after mutating the NF1 39UTR of miR-193b, thereby validating NF1 as a bona fide miR-193b target (Fig.3E)."
miR-193b,PER2,"Similarly, a luciferase construct was designed for PER2 but demonstrated only a weak interaction with miR-193b (Fig.S3D)."

miR-200c,pGL3-UTRm,"Luciferase expression driven by pGL3-UTRm was 1.6-fold higher as compared with pGL3-UTR in A2780 cells, demonstrating that the predicted site of interaction with miR-200c was indeed recognized by a negative regulator (Figure 2E)."
miR-190,PHLPP1,These results clearly indicated that p50 expression was crucial for arsenite-induced miR-190 expression and that miR-190 could suppress PHLPP1 translation by interacting with binding sites of PHLPP1 mRNA 30-UTR.
miR-21,YOD1,"WB results showed that miR-21 mimic transfection led to a ,40% (from 1.00 to 0.62) reduction in YOD1 levels compared with miRCL."
miR-105,ZO-1,The four predicted miR-105 binding sites in the 30UTR of human ZO-1 were cloned into a reporter plasmid and assessed for their responsiveness to miR-105 in HMVECs.
miR-34c,ATF1,"Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-34c reduces ATF1 protein expression without affecting ATF1 mRNA level via directly binding to ATF1's 3'UTR, indicating that ATF1 is one of miR-34c's target genes."
miR-1,PTMA,"To assess the miR-1 target gene PTMA (prothymosin alpha, ProTalpha) involves in apoptosis, we used PTMA siRNA to knock down PTMA."
miR-106b,PTEN,"To investigate if PTEN was a potential target gene of miR-106b, DAOY and ONS-76 cells were transfected with either miR-106b inhibitor or negative control, and cell lysates were harvested at 24 h post transfection."

miR-31,Ku80 mRNA,It is likely that miR-31 modulates Ku80 mRNA expression.
miR-502,IFI27,"To validate whether miR-502 directly recognizes the 30-UTRs of IFI27 messenger RNA, we cloned the 30 UTR of IFI27 to the pGL3 luciferase reporter gene to generate pGL3-IFI27-30 UTR or pGL3 control vector Luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with miR-502 mimics and pGL3-IFI27-30 UTR vector was decreased when compared with the control (Fig.4B)."
miR-1552/2,HIF-1a,"Importantly, a greater increase of HIF-1a mRNA or protein levels was observed in tumor- infiltrating as well as spleen miR-1552/2 MDSCs than WT ones (Figs. 5a and 5b)."

miR-340,p27,We then investigated if SKP2 downregulation could recapitulate the miR-340 effect on p27 expression.
miR-130b,MMP2,"Among them, we found that miR-130b potentially targetsMMP2, which is frequently overexpressed in tumor tissues and critical for tumor metastasis."
miR-130b,MMP2,The 30-UTR of MMP2 mRNA contains putative binding site for miR-130b (Figure 4A).We cloned the humanMMP2 30-UTR into a luciferase reporter plasmid and co-transfected it with miR-130b into HEK293T cells.

miR-372,PHLPP2,A significant negative correlation between miR-372 levels and PHLPP2 mRNA expression was also observed (Fig.4B).
miR-372,PHLPP2,qPCR and Western blot analyses showed that inhibition of miR-372 increased the levels of PHLPP2 mRNA and protein in both U87 and LN229 cell lines (Fig.4C).
miR-372,30-UTR region,"Then we performed luciferase reporter assay and the result showed that the luciferase activity of cells transfected with miR-372 I was significantly increased, whereas the mutation of the putative miR-372-binding sites in 30-UTR region clearly abrogated the increase of the luciferase activity caused by miR-372 I transfection (Fig.4D)."
miR-99a,AKT1,"As shown in Figure 4B, miR-99a overexpression inhibited the transcriptional activity of a luciferase reporter containing the AKT1 30UTR, but did not affect the activity of a mutated reporter construct lacking the miR-99a binding site (Fig.4B)."
miR-302a,BMP2,Transfection of miR-302a or BMP2 treatment in MC3T3-E1 cells increased cellular level of miR-302a (Fig.5A and Supplementary Fig.3A).

miR-302a,COUP-TFII,Treatment of anti-miR-302a recovered COUP-TFII expression by repressing miR-302 cluster expression (Figs. 5C and D).
miR-302,COUP-TFII,These results suggested that the miR-302 cluster regulates COUP-TFII mRNA and protein expression.
miR-101,KLF6,"To determine whether KLF6 30-UTR is a direct target of miR-101, pre-miR-101 and KLF6 30-UTR reporter construct (KLF6-30UTR-Wt) was cotransfected into HEK293T cells and luciferase activity was measured."
miR-101,KLF6,These results indicated that miR-101 targeted the 30- UTR of KLF6.
miR-101,KLF6,"To find out whether miR-101 directly targets KLF6 through the putative binding site, pre-miR-101 and the KLF6 30- UTR mutated reporter construct (KLF6-30UTR-Mut) was cotransfected into cells."
miR-101,KLF6,"Overexpression of miR-101 did not change the luciferase activities (Figure 3D), which indicated that KLF6 was a direct target of miR-101 with the specific binding site."
miR-26a,PTEN,The mechanism in AGS cells may be the indirect regulation of PTEN by miR-26a overcame the direct targeting regulation.
miR-22,YWHAZ,"Additionally, through gene expression profiles and bioinformatics analysis, YWHAZ was identified to be a direct target of miR-22 and its overexpression partially counteracted the inhibitory effects of miR-22 on HCC cells."
MiR-135a-5p,KLF4,MiR-135a-5p promoted proliferation and metastasis in HCC cells by direct targeting KLF4 both in vitro and in vivo.
miR-141,Stat5,Treatment with a miR-141 mimic blocked P4-mediated Stat5 upregulation (Figure 5a).
miR-141,Stat5a,miR-141 mimic significantly decreased luciferase activity for the Stat5a miR-141 site construct in both T47D and BT474 cells; mutation of the predicted miR-141-binding site blocked this decrease (Figure 5b).
miR-141,Stat5b,We also analyzed a predicted miR-141 site in Stat5b and found no significant regulation (Supplementary Figure 5).
miR-141,Stat5a,These data support that miR-141 directly and specifically regulates Stat5a in breast cancer cells.
miR-145,ARF6,"To test the predicted binding of miR-145 to ARF6 mRNA, we cloned the ARF6 30UTR downstream a luciferase ORF and performed luciferase reporter assays for ARF6 30UTR."
miR-145,ARF6,"However, following miR-145 overexpression, we detected a dramatic decrease in ARF6 protein levels (Fig.3F)."
miR-145,ARF6,These data suggest that miR-145 inhibition of ARF6 is mostly occurring by interfering with ARF6 translation.
miR-148a,ACVR1,A receptor type 1 (ACVR1) expression was significantly negatively correlated with miR-148a and was significantly differentially expressed in Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 (Fig.3B).

miR-122,OCLN,"To experimentally verify that the putative miR-122 binding site is functional, Huh7.5 cells were transfected with miR-122 mimic and OCLN mRNA and protein levels were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting respectively."
miR-122,OCLN,"However, Huh7.5 cells transfected with miR-122 mimic showed a significant reduction in the expression of OCLN protein levels (80% after 48 h) compared with negative control (Fig.2 B and C)."
miR-122,OCLN,"To further establish the interaction between miR-122 and OCLN 30-UTR, a mutant miR-122 was created in which the seed match site for the 30-UTR of OCLN mRNA was abolished (Fig.3B)."

miR-122,OCLN,This further indicated that miR-122 binds 30- UTR of OCLN mRNA.
miR-99b,NOX4,Cotransfection of NOX4-wtUTR and 100 nM miR-99b mimic caused an 67% reduction in firefly/renilla ratios (Fig.5C).
miR-99b,NOX4,"However, deleting the miR-99b binding sites (NOX4-delUTR) restored firefly/renilla ratios to the level observed with unmanipulated pmirGLO vector (Fig.5C)."
thismiRNA cluster,HER2,"To further confirm that the HER2 protein is targeted by these miRNAs, we cloned the 30-UTR of HER2, the gene that encodes the HER2 protein, downstream of Renilla luciferase, and determined changes in the level of luciferase activity in the presence of the mimics and anti-miRs of thismiRNA cluster."

miR-648,ET-1-3=UTR,"Cotransfection of pGL3- ET-1-3=UTR reporter with miR-648 (90 pmol) modestly reduced luciferase activity under basal conditions (Fig.4B, lane 3 versus lane 2)."
miR-27b,EGFR,Expression of EGFR protein was significantly repressed in miR-27b transfectants in comparison with mock or miRcontrol transfectants (Fig.4).
miR-27b,EGFR,"We found that the luminescence intensity was significantly reduced by transfection of miR-27b with the wild-type vector carrying the 3'-UTR of EGFR (position 200-207: P<0.0001; position 430-436: P<0.0001; Fig.5B), whereas transfection with a mutant vector showed no decrease in luminescence."
miR-340,MITF,This finding suggested that the short 3-UTR of MITF mRNA was sufficient for miR-340-mediated inhibition.
miR-222,ABCG2,"ABCG2 is a direct target of miR-222,and deregulation of the miR-222-ABCG2 regulatory module in TSCC contributes to both DDP resistance and enhanced migratory/invasive potential."
miR-340,mutant mRNA,"On the other hand, miR-340 inhibition had no additional effect on the luciferase activity of mutant mRNA (Fig.3C)."

let-7,E2F5,"Taken together, these results demonstrate that E2F5 is a novel target of let-7 that is important in skeletal myoblasts and suggest that E2F5 is a previously uncharacterized regulator of terminal myogenic differentiation."
let-7,E2F5,"Consistent with this finding, suppression of let-7 was recently shown to directly up-regulate E2F5 and thus decrease proliferation of chondrocytes [12]."
miR-22,MTDH,"To further confirm that MTDH is a target gene of miR-22, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses were performed to detect whether the expression of MTDH is regulated by miR-22 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells infected with miR-26a or scramble lentivirus."
miR-26a,MTDH,The result showed a notable reduction of the mRNA and protein levels of MTDH in the cells infected with miR-26a compared with those infected with scramble lentivirus (Fig.4A).
miR-26a,MTDH,The above results prompted us to examine whether miR-26a inhibits TBNC growth and metastasis by repressing MTDH expression.
miR-26a,MTDH,"In miR- 26a-expressing cells, the re-expression of MTDH rescued the invasion and growth defects of miR-26a (Fig.4C and D)."
miR-19a,TGFbR2,"Transfection of BEC from controls with a miR-19a mimic induced a significant decrease in TGF-b receptor 2 mRNA expression levels (Fig.4A), while silencing of miR-19a using miR-19a inhibitor in BEC from severe asthmatics resulted in an increase of TGFbR2 gene expression, indicating that miR-19a regulates TGFbR2 gene expression (Fig.4A)."
miR-19a,TGFbR2,"Western blots revealed that the protein level of TGFbR2 was markedly reduced in the cells overexpressing miR-19a compared to the nontransfected cells (33.55  4.98% vs 100  15.62%; P = 0.0279), and silencing of miR-19a resulted in an increase of TGF-b receptor 2 protein level (76.94  3.22% vs 27.4  0.67%; P = 0.0021) (Fig.4B)."
miR-98,IGF1R,"These findings suggest that miR-98 inhibits cancer cell growth and metastasis by direct targeting IGF1R, implicating miR-98 as a novel potential therapeutic target for OSCC."

miR-21,CASC2,"The results showed that overexpressed pmirGLO-CASC2 compared with the miR-21-NC group, and miR-21 did not affect the mutated pmirGLO-CASC2-Mut luciferase activity (P b 0.01; Fig.3C, D)."
miR-638,CDK2,Mutation of site 1 in the 3-UTR (CDK2-M1) slightly impaired the inhibitory effect of miR-638.
miR-19a,SOCS1,CONCLUSIONS: Our finding indicate that SOCS1 is a direct target of miR-19a in neuropathic pain rats and miR-19a may play a critical role in regulating of neuropathic pain via targeting SOCS1.

miR-320a,MMP-9,"To demonstrate the physiological significance of miR-320a in human B cells, we studied whether decreased expression of endogenous miR- 320a is mechanistically linked to increased expression of its proinflammatory target molecule MMP-9."
miR-320a,MMP-9,B cells from healthy donors were transfected with specific inhibitor to miR-320a (anti-miR-320a) or negative control miRNA inhibitor (anti-miR control) followed by analysis of MMP-9 protein expression in cells and its secretion in the culture medium.
miR-320a,MMP-9,Treatment with anti-miR-320a led to significant upregulation of cellular MMP-9 protein in B cells (Fig.3A) as well as increased spontaneous secretion (Fig.3B).
miR-17-3p,Par4,"To confirm targeting of Par4 by miR-17-3p, we generated luciferase constructs harboring either a fragment of Par4 or the same fragment containing a mutation in the binding site (Fig.3A, right)."
miR-17-3p,Par4,"Luciferase activity was repressed when the construct (Luc-Par4) was co-transfected with miR-17-3p mimic, and the repression was abolished when the target site was mutated, thus confirming direct targeting of Par4 by miR-17-3p (Fig.3B)"
hsa-miR-516a-3p,WNT5A,"In DPSCs, dramatic reduction of WNT5A mRNA was detected in overexpressed hsa-miR-516a-3p by qRT-PCR analysis as well as in the western blot result, while knockdown of has-miR-516a-3p enhanced their expression (Fig.5B)."
miR-497-5p,KCa3.1,The direct targeting of KCa3.1 by miR-497-5p was evidenced by reduced luciferase activity due to complementary binding of miR-497-5p to KCa3.1 mRNA 3' untranslated region.
miR-203,BMI1,"Overexpression of miR-203 significantly suppressed luciferase activity of BMI1 wild-type 30UTR reporter constructs in both A375 and A2058 cells (Fig.2B), while the suppressive effect of pre-miR-203 was abrogated with mutant BMI1 30UTR."
miR-203,TYMS,LoVo and Caco2 cells were co-transfected with either miR-203 ASO or miR-203 mimics and wild-type or mutant TYMS 3'UTR for luciferase assay.
miR-203,TYMS,"As shown in Fig.4B, we found that LoVo cells with miR-203 ASO had a higher level of TYMS 3'UTR intensity than the control cells, while Caco2 cells with miR-203 mimics had a lower intensity."
miR-203,TYMS,"However, neither miR-203 ASO nor miR-203 mimics affected the intensity of mutant TYMS 3'UTR (Fig.4B)."
miR-203,TYMS,The luciferase assay suggests that miR-203 suppresses TYMS expression via binding to its 3'UTR.
miR-26b,COX-2,"In agreement with the computer prediction, COX-2 protein levels were significantly suppressed in the miR-26b mimic group whereas these levels were increased in the miR-26b inhibitor group (Fig.3B)."
miR-26b,COX-2,"No reduction in luciferase activity was observed in the SCC-4 cells transfected with miR-26b mimics and mutated COX-2, but an ~45% reduction in luciferase activity was observed in wild-type COX-2 (P<0.05, Fig.3D)."

miR-449a,MAZ,These results indicated that miR-449a could inhibit MAZ expression in human GBM cell lines and GSCs.
miR30a,LOX,Overexpression of miR30a in ATC cells decreased LOX protein expression in four ATC cell lines with low basal miR30a expression levels (Fig.3A).
miR30a,LOX,"To determine whether LOX is regulated by miR30a through direct binding to the 30UTR region of LOX, the LOX- 30 UTR was inserted into a luciferase reporter vector."
miR30a,30UTR-LOX,"Transfection of 30UTR-LOX, along withmiR30a, into ATC cell lines led to a significant decrease in luciferase activity compared with the cotransfection of 30UTR-LOX with miR-C (Fig.3B)."

miR-494,HOXA10,"Transfection of miR-494-mimic with HOXA10 30UTR luciferase reporter showed 20% reduction compared with NS control in firefly luciferase activity by the dual luciferase assay using HEK293 cells as reporter system (Fig.6, p = 0.0052)."
miR-27b,CRISP2,"Notably, our results revealed that miR-27b significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of reporter genes containing 30-UTR of CRISP2 compared with the controls (Fig.3C), indicating that CRISP2 was a miR-27b target and miR-27b might be involved in asthenozoospermia by directly suppressing CRISP2."
miR-200b,WASF3,"To confirm that miR-200b directly targets WASF3, the full length and two fragments of WASF3 3'UTR containing miR-200b binding siteswere separately cloned into the downstream of a luciferase reporter gene to construct plasmids pGL3-W, pGL3-W-1 and pGL3-W-2."
miR-25,FBXW7,"As shown in Fig.3D, exogenous expression of miR-25 caused approximately 50% reduction of the luciferase activity with the wild-type 30UTR of FBXW7, whereas no obvious changes of luciferase activity was observed with the mutant 30UTR in response to the miRNA expression."
miR-25,FBXW7,"Thus, our results indicated that miR-25 could directly regulate FBXW7 expression through the miRNA binding site in its 30UTR."
miR-24,c-Myc,"Since miR-24 has been reported to be able to down-regulate c-Myc by binding to its seedless 30 UTR in human cells (Lal et al, 2009), the reporter harboring the entire 30 UTR of c-Myc was also engineered."
miRNA-107,CLOCK,CLOCK mRNA was most concentrated in AGO2-miRNA-107 complexes in cells overexpressing miRNA-107 than in cells transfected with the scramble (5.2-fold; p < 0.05).
miRNA-107,CLOCK,These results suggest that miRNA-107 directly bind to and regulate CLOCK.

miR-34a,SLC22A12,"Luciferasereporterconstructswithmutationsatthepredicted miR-34abindingsitewithintheSLC22A12-30UTR, weregenerated."
miR-1470,c-jun,"To determine whether the negative regulatory effects miR-1470 exerted on c-jun expression were mediated through the binding of miR-1470 to the presumed sites in the 30-UTR of the c-jun mRNA, we fused part of the c-jun 30-UTR, which included the predicted miR-1470 binding sites, to the downstream of the luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig.6B)."
miR-1470,c-jun,"Furthermore, we introduced point mutations into the corresponding seed complementary sites in the c-jun 30-UTR to eliminate the predicted miR-1470 binding site."
miR-1470,mincs,"As shown in Figure 6C, mutations in the complementary seed sites almost fully rescued the repression of the reporter activity caused by the expression of miR-1470 mincs."
miR-181c,TLR4,Co-expression with miR-181c mimics significantly suppressed the activity of a firefly luciferase reporter containing wild-type TLR4 30UTR but had no effect on a reporter with a mutated TLR4 30UTR (Fig.4b and c).
miR-181c,TLR4,We found that the mRNA level of TLR4 in the cells transfected with miR-181c was significantly lower than those in the control cells.
miR-181c,TLR4,While the mRNA level of TLR4 in the cells co-transfected miR-181c mimics and target protector oligos was significantly higher than those in the cells co-transfected miR-181c mimics and negative control target protector (Fig.4d).
miR-30,RASAL2,"Mutagenesis of one of the predicted target sites of miR-30 in the RASAL2 3=-UTR, a conserved site between the human and mouse RASAL2 gene 3=-UTR, abolished all effects of miR-30 isoform overexpression on luciferase activity."
miR-429,HIF1A,"In order to determine if miR-429 directly interacts with the HIF1A target sequence, we used a specific TP to test if the predicted binding site in the HIF1AmRNAwas correct.TPs aremodifiedRNAs complementary tomiRNA target sequences that bind to the specific mRNA target sequence and block miRNA binding and thus prevent the formationof themiRNA-mRNAcomplex (34).As shownin Fig.7, the HIF1A TP reverses themiR-429mimic inhibitor effects on both mRNA and HIF-1a protein levels, suggesting that the predicted target sequence identified is correct."
miR-429,HIF-1a,"Furthermore, the results from Figs. 6 and 7 suggest that miR-429 limits HIF-1a expression during both normoxic and hypoxic conditions."
miR-152,XIST,"Using bioinformatics databases (Starbase v2.0 [28,29], miRcode [30] and RNAhybrid [31]), XISTwas predicted to harbor one miR-152 binding site."

miR-152,XIST,"Cotransfection of pre-miR-152 and XIST-Wt strongly decreased the luciferase activity, while co-transfection of pre-miR-152-NC and XISTWt did not change the luciferase activity, suggesting that XIST was a target of miR-152."
miR-152,XIST-Mut,Co-transfection of pre-miR-152 and XIST-Mut did not change the luciferase activity (Fig.6C).
miR-152,XIST,These results suggested that the miR-152 binding site within XISTwas functional.

miR-34a,LEF1,"The transfection of miR-34a mimic leads to an approximately 2-fold decrease of LEF1 expression in LNCaP-AI cells, suggesting that miR-34a mimics may exert regulation on 30-UTR of LEF1 (Fig.2B)."
miR-34a,LEF1,"Meanwhile, LEF1 expression in LNCaP-LEF1 cells was not affected by transfection of miR-34a mimic due to lack of LEF1 30-UTR in the plasmid used to stably overexpress LEF1 (Fig.2B)."
miR-34a,LEF1,"Consistently, miR-34a inhibited LEF1 expression with cotransfection of miR-34a and a plasmid of LEF1 containing 30- UTR in LNCaP-AI cells (Fig.2C)."
