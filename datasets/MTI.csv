"In a luciferase assay in which the 3 -UTRs of SOD1 and SOD2 were included in  the  pGL3R  vector,  miR-377,  but  not  miR-143  as control,    considerably    reduced    luciferase    activity (Fig.4A)","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have previously been associated with cancer progression and sensitivity to chemotherapy; therefore, the present study aimed to identify miRNAs that may influence the sensitivity of human gastric cancer cells to cisplatin (DDP) treatment."

The luciferase activity assays at 24 hours post transfection demonstrated that miR-34a suppressed luciferase reporter activity by 50% (Figure 3c),The miR-199a-5p/SIRT1 pathway may thus represent a potential target for the prevention and treatment of epilepsy and epileptic damage.
"As expected, this suppression was abolished by deleting part of the perfectly complementary sequences in the BCL2 3`-UTR  (pGL3-mutBcl2-30UTR)  which  disrupts  the  interaction between miR-15b/miR-16 and BCL2 (Fig.3d).","Accordingly, the analysis of neoplastic and matched normal lung tissues reveals that miR-206 downregulation in lung tumors correlates, in most cases, with higher cyclin D1 levels."

"In cells treated with a miR-205 mimic, we found a marked reduction ( 50%) in luciferase activity [Fig.1 C and D and supporting information (SI) Fig.S1B]; however, no reduction in luciferase activity was seen in transfectants expressing miR-184 (Fig.S1A and Fig.1D), suggesting that miR-184 does not inhibit SHIP2.",We have developed an algorithm for predicting targets that does not rely on evolutionary conservation.
"To confirm this result, we mutated the miR-205 binding site on SHIP2 3 `UTR (Fig.1B, SHIP2 mut1).","Mechanically, LINC00461 was confirmed to sponge miR-216a to affect AQP4 expression."

These results all indicate RECK is a direct target of miR-21.,"Further experiments showed that miR-155 and BIC, the gene that encodes miR-155, were induced as early as four hours post-infection in primary human monocytes."
"Transfections with mimics for miR-186 and for miR-150 decreased  Fluc/Rluc  activity  by  20  and  27%,  respectively, whereas transfections with mimics for miR-186 plus miR-150 decreased Fluc/Rluc activity by 32% (p   0.01 compared with control, Fig.8B).",A positive staining of miR-21 was observed in 15 of 17 IDC cases.
"The combined effect of the miR-186 plus miR-150 mimics was greater than the effect of the miR-186 mimic alone (Fig.8B, p   0.01).",The increase in miR-148a was accompanied by a decrease in EPAS1 expression in Caco-2 cells and cecum (p < 0.05).

"As shown in Figure 5B, mir-21 suppressed the luciferase activity of the Luc-PDCD4 3`-UTR by more than 50% compared with the vector control,whereas deletion of the mir-21 binding site (underlined in Figure 5A) blocked this suppression (Figure 5B).",The decreased levels in the circulation may reflect decreased vascular release but more studies are needed to confirm this relationship.
"Similarly, mir-21 also suppressed the luciferase activity of the LucMaspin 3`-UTR by more than 40% compared with the vector control (Figure 5B), and deletion of the mir-21 binding site (underlined) reversed this suppression.",Here we found that iron deficiency as well as hypoxia promoted microRNA-210 (miR-210) expression.
"Thus, miR-21 down-regulates PDCD4 at the translational level in T98G glioblastoma cell line.","miRNA always mediates target mRNA degradation or translation repression modestly; thus, the net effect of miR-466l's binding to IL-10 AU-rich elements is to prevent IL-10 mRNA degradation mediated by tristetraprolin, resulting in extended t(1/2) of IL-10 mRNA and elevated IL-10 expression."
"From this, we conclude that the miR-130a consensus binding sequences in the GAX 3'UTR mediate the down-regulation of GAX by mitogens and proangiogenic factors.","The cellular pathways that attenuate hepatic ER stress have been the focus of many recent studies, but the role of microRNAs (miRNA) in this process remains unknown."

"This region is evolutionary conserved and present in the Dnmt3b splice variants Dnmt3b1, Dnmt3b2, and Dnmt3b4, but not in the abundantly expressed Dnmt3b3.",A possible role for miRNA editing in altering the lung mRNA target repertoire was also identified.
"the expression of miR-148a affects the mRNA stability of Dnmt3b1, but not Dnmt3b3, leading to a relative increase in the abundance of Dnmt3b3 compared with Dnmt3b1 and all other Dnmt3b splice variants that express the targeted site.","To identify specific targets, we used bioinformatics analysis to predict whether miR-636 targets the 3'-UTR mRNA regions of IL1R1 and RANK (two pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors), IKBKB (a major protein in the NF-ÎºB pathway), and FAM13A (a modifier gene of CF lung phenotype implicated in epithelial remodelling)."

The interaction of miR-125b or its paralog miR-125a with two imperfectly complementary elements (miRE1 and miRE2) in the 3' UTR of the mammalian lin-28 message leads to significant reductions in both translation and mRNA abundance.,"Using miRNA arrays, we identified an miRNA differentially expressed between the MDA-MB-231 cell line and its highly metastatic variant."
We examined the effect of lin-28 miRE1 on the decay of a B-globin reporter mRNA (BG) expressed in 293T cells under the control of a transiently inducible c-fos promoter.,Real-time quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that miR-542-3p was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and cell lines (pÂ <Â 0.001).
These findings indicate that miR-125b can destabilize mRNA by interacting with imperfectly complementary 3' UTR elements and hastening deadenylation as an initial step in accelerated decay.,"Control of viral lytic replication is essential for KSHV latency, evasion of the host immune system and induction of tumours."
The presence of two copies of miRE1 in the 3' UTR (BG+2E1) markedly accelerated the decay of the reporter mRNA in cells that had been engineered to produce miR-125b at a concentration comparable with that in differentiating P19 cells.,Ectopic expression and knockdown studies showed that c-Myc indeed suppresses expression of primary and mature miR-122 in hepatic cells.
"mRNA destabilization involving fast poly(A) removal was likewise observed for an element derived from MKK7 (MAPK kinase 7) mRNA, another message downregulated by miR-125b in P19 cells (Fig.2B; see also Fig.9, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).","In conclusion, our data revealed that miR-126 functions as a tumor suppressor in CRC cells by regulating CXCR4 expression via the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and might be a novel target for therapeutic strategies in CRC."
These findings indicate that miR-125b can expedite the deadenylation and decay of many different mRNAs bearing a variety of elements to which it is imperfectly complementary.,"Near the end of neural development, most asymmetric division ends and precursors differentiate."
"Besides lin-28, the P19 messages down-regulated by miR- 125b included Ajuba mRNA, whose 3' UTR contains a likely miR-125b-responsive element in both mice and humans (A1; Fig.2B).","We examined the role of miRNAs, particularly in the regulation of GLUT4, the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, in the AT of PCOS and matched control subjects."
"This reduction in mRNA was a consequence of accelerated deadenylation and decay, as evidenced by the ability of one copy of L7 to cause rapid poly(A) shortening and subsequent degradation of BG+L7 mRNA in 293T cells transfected with a gene encoding let-7a (Fig.3C; see also Fig.6).",We constructed a transgenic UAS-miRNA library in Drosophila melanogaster that contains 180 fly miRNAs.
"That these effects were not cell-type-specific and could be caused by an endogenous miRNA was demonstrated by showing a similar influence of L7 on mRNA deadenylation and decay in HeLa cells (Fig.3D), which produce let-7 naturally.","In conclusion, our data demonstrated that miR-513a-3p can sensitize human lung adenocarcinoma cells to cisplatin by targeting GSTP1."
"A second miRNA, let-7, also helps to down-regulate lin-28 gene expression in differentiating P19 cells by interacting with a distinct 3' UTR element (L7; Fig.3A).",Macroautophagy (autophagy) is the major intracellular degradation pathway for long-lived proteins and organelles.
Here we report the identification of human lin-28 mRNA as a regulatory target of human miR-125b and its homolog miR-125a.,The ABA and IAA related factors were differentially expressed in the mutants.
"Studies of miR-125b function in mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells induced to develop into neurons suggest a role for this regulatory miRNA in mammalian neuronal differentiation, since its increased concentration in these cells contributes to lin-28 downregulation.","Here, we report that miR-138 is commonly underexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) specimens and NPC cell lines."
"Whatever modest responsiveness remained in the reporter lacking both miRE1 and miRE2 was abolished when a third, weaker element (miRE0) (Fig.3) was removed as well (because of its minimal efficacy, deleting miRE0 alone from the lin-28 3'UTR had little influence on repression).",How progranulin (PGRN) expression is regulated is largely unknown.
"Thus, miRE1 and miRE2 appear to be the principal elements within the human lin-28 3'UTR that mediate repression by miR-125a and miR-125b, and both are necessary for efficient downregulation.","More importantly, we found that miR-31-knockdown ASCs dramatically improved the repair of CSDs, including increased bone volume, increased bone mineral density (BMD) and decreased scaffold residue in vivo."
Additional experiments showed that miRE1 and miRE2 are alone sufficient to direct repression by miR-125a and miR-125b when each is inserted in multiple copies into another luciferase reporter bearing a 3'UTR derived from SV40.,"Furthermore, the levels of Dicer inversely correlate with PMP22, while the inhibition of Dicer leads to elevated PMP22."
"By contrast, inserting multiple copies of other lin-28 3'UTR elements with the potential to form thermodynamically favorable duplexes with miR-125a and miR-125b (element X or element Y) had no such effect, and insertion of miRE0 alone had only a small effect (Fig.2C and 3).","These results indicate new strategies for probing autonomic circulatory control and ultimately, susceptibility to hypertensive renal sequelae."
"The repressive influence of miRE1 and miRE2 on reporter gene expression was also observed in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which naturally produce miR-125b at a concentration similar to that in transfected 293T cells (data not shown).",Thirty-five miRNAs were identified.
"In mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells induced to differentiate into neurons, a marked increase in miR-125b abundance helps to downregulate lin-28 gene expression.","miR-138 represses expression of both BCR-ABL and CCND3 via binding to the coding region and 3'-UTR, respectively."
That miR-125b in particular likely contributes to lin-28 repression during differentiation of P19 cells was implied by experiments showing that this miRNA is able to downregulate expression of the endogenous lin-28 gene in undifferentiated P19 cells engineered to produce miR-125b at a physiological concentration.,"Here, we investigated the effect of miR-145 on osteogenic differentiation."
"This study shows that oncogenic microRNA, miR-21, represses RHOB expression by directly targeting the 3' untranslated region.","Moreover, up-regulated of PTCH1 could attenuate the effect induced by miR-212."
"Collectively, our data demonstrate that the impairment of miR24 and miR93 production caused by Dicer1 deficiency is the major cause of the observed increase in susceptibility to VSV in Dicer1d/d mice.","In particular, down-regulation of hsa-let-7c was observed in BL cases, compared to normal controls."
"We found that host miR24 and miR93 could target viral large protein (L protein) and phosphoprotein (P protein) genes, and a lack of miR24 and miR93 was responsible for increased VSV replication in Dicer1d/d cells.","Here, we extended our search for target genes and identified MKK7, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, as a novel target of miR-493."
We then showed that miR-29a negatively regulated collagen IV by directly targeting the 3'UTRs of col4a1 and col4a2.,"Specifically, we identify miR-125b and miR-326 as suppressors of the pathway activator Smoothened together with miR-324-5p, which also targets the downstream transcription factor Gli1."
"Consistent with the results of the reporter assay, the virus titer was approximately five and four times greater in the anti-miR24- and anti-miR93-treated cells, respectively (Figure 5E), whereas anti-miR146 and antimiR378 only had a modest effect on VSV replication in macrophages (Figure 5E).","Although recent studies have shown the important role of miR-125b in several tumors and overexpression of miR-125b in advanced EC, its function in this disease has not yet been defined."
"Although no changes in EGFP fluorescence were observed for the EGFP and EGFP-2 or 3X MREs of lmo2, alas2, and klf12 (Figure S8A,C-E), a dramatic suppression of EGFP expression was obtained in the embryos injected with control EGFP-2X PT and EGFP-2X MRE-klfd mRNAs (Figure S8B,F), suggesting that the MRE of klfd 3'-UTR can be efficiently targeted by miR-144.",Vertebrate multiciliated cells (MCCs) contribute to fluid propulsion in several biological processes.
"Indeed, we have confirmed that miR-107 targets NF1-A",Forced down-expression of miR-34c-5p decreased the expression of UVB-SIPS induced P21 and P53 at both mRNA and protein levels.
"Interestingly, we found that miR-107, which is predicted to target NFI-A, (Figure 4a) was upregulated as well after ATRA treatment (Figure 2d).","Lastly, miR-27b through PPARÎ³ regulates nuclear factor-ÎºB activity and transcription of inflammatory target genes."
"To confirm a direct interaction between these two genes, we cloned the NFI-A 3' untranslated region (UTRs) predicted to interact with miR-107 into a pGL3 luciferase reporter vector.","We also assessed the body weight, fat mass and the content of serum lipid in rats subcutaneous injected with BPA and miR-21a-5p mimics."
"When the miR-107 precursor oligonucleotide was transfected into the NB4 cells along with the reporter plasmid containing the NFI-A 3'UTR sequence by nucleoporation, a 40% reduction of normalized luciferase activity was observed compared with the control scrambled oligonucleotide (Figure 4b)","Like other cancers, aberrant gene regulation features significantly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)."

"We further show that miR-224 can inhibit cell invasion and directly targets CDC42 and CXCR4, and that suppression of CDC42 and CXCR4 by RNAi causes inhibition of Ubc9-mediated invasion.","Additionally, Hnf-3Î², a liver enriched transcription factor that activates miR-122 gene, was suppressed in c-MYC-induced tumors."

A significantly increased luciferase activity was observed in both genes (RTN4 and NCAPG) containing perfect 7-mer seed matches upon miR-21 inhibition (Fig.6B).,"We developed a method for CLIP data analysis, and applied it to compare CLIP with photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP (PAR-CLIP) and to uncover how differences in cross-linking and ribonuclease digestion affect the identified sites."

"A Western blot performed on the same cells showed that bcl2 protein was clearly reduced (49%) in the stable transfection cell line of miR-34a, as compared to cells transfected with the control vector (Fig.4B and C).",Cyclin T1 is a regulatory subunit of a general RNA polymerase II elongation factor known as P-TEFb.
"However, when we used, as a reporter construct, a plasmid containing the 3UTR of bcl2 mRNA where the core binding site for miR-34a was inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis, we observed only a very slight effect on luciferase activity (Fig.3).","Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by infection, resulting in organ dysfunction."
"Fig.2B and C showed that the level of bcl2 protein was decreased both in 3-month-old and 6-month-old APPswe/PSE9 mice compared with age-matched controls, which is inversely linked to the expression of miR-34a.","Overexpression of miR-199a-3p in SGC-7901 cells inhibited ZHX1 expression, while reduction in miR-199a-3p by inhibitors in NCI-N87 cells enhanced ZHX1 expression."
We also detected the mRNA level of bcl2 in cerebral cortex of APPswe/PSE9 mice and controls using real-time RT-PCR and Fig.2D showed that the mRNA expression is not changed.,Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells maintain immune homeostasis by limiting different types of inflammatory responses.

miR-206 targets and regulates human notch3.,"Colon cancer is a common malignancy, and its incidence and mortality have been increasing in recent years."
"As expected, miR-206 showed a strong inhibitory effect on normal (Fig.2A, left) but not deleted (Fig.2A, right) or mutated (supplemental Fig.S2B) human notch3 3'-UTR-luciferase activity.","This is often associated with elevated expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 (eIF4E), the rate-limiting factor of cap-dependent translation initiation."
"Similarly, forced expression of full-length notch3 largely rescued the repressive effect of miR-206 on human notch3 3'-UTR-lucif- erase activity (Fig.2A, left).","Conversely, overexpression of miR-33b impaired preadipocyte proliferation and reduced lipid droplet formation and the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) target genes during differentiation."
"When the cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of miR-206, the repression of the human notch3 3'-UTR by miR-206 was moderately released (Fig.2B, left), suggesting that a higher dose of the miR-206 inhibitor would be required to efficiently block the inhibitory effect of miR-206 on the activity of the human notch3 3'-UTR.","MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) is downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the underlying mechanisms by which it suppresses tumorigenesis in NSCLC are largely unknown."
"As expected, ectopic expression of miR-206 resulted in a significant reduction of human Notch3 protein expression (Fig.2C and supplemental Fig.S3A).",ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent a large group of efflux pumps that are strongly involved in the pharmacokinetics of various drugs and nutrient distribution.

Cotransfection of cells with the parental luciferase construct (without the notch3 3'-UTR) plus the miR-206 expression plasmid did not change the expression of the reporter (data not shown).,"In particular, PML/RARÎ±-positive blasts from APL patients display lower levels of miRNA let-7c, a member of the let-7 family, than normal promyelocytes and its expression increases after ATRA treatment."
"However, miR-206 dose-dependently decreased the luciferase activity when cotransfected with the mouse notch3 3'-UTR containing the miR-206 target site (Fig.1B, left).","We also found that transfection with precursorÂ miR-10bÂ into gastric cancer cells dramatically decreased MAPRE1 mRNA and protein, resulting in a significant decrease in colony formation and cell growth rates."
"The inhibitory effect of miR-206 on mouse notch3 3'-UTR activity was partially rescued by coexpression of a full-length notch3 plasmid, suggesting that notch3 was effective in inhibiting the ability of miR-206 to inhibit the expression of the reporter gene containing the miR-206-binding site.","In addition, sustained suppression of SIRT7 reduced the in vivo tumor growth rate in a mouse xenograft model."
"In addition, suppression of the notch3 3'-UTR by miR-206 was relieved by deletion (Fig.1B, right) or mutation (supplemental Fig.S2A) of the miR-206-binding site and was markedly recovered by a specific miR-206 inhibitor (Fig.1C) whose function is to block the cleavage of precursor miR-206 to mature miR-206 (21).",BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) is a known proto-oncogene.
"Furthermore, overexpression of miR-206 markedly decreased the levels of endogenous mouse Notch3 protein (Fig.1D) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas cel-miR-64 had no effect on mouse Notch33 protein expression.",The target genes of miR-130a-3p and the associated signalling pathways were identified using bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification of the interactions between the target predicted by the algorithms and dysregulated mRNAs.
"Co-transfection of the reporter plasmid along with miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-429, as well as each or both of the clusters in 4TO7 cells, resulted in a significantly reduced ZEB2-3'-UTR-luciferase expression, suggesting that these miRNAs are likely to target ZEB2 directly (Fig.2D, left panel).","We investigated in detail one miRNA, miR-24, and found that it is a novel regulator of Oxt and controls both transcript and peptide levels of Oxt."
"In reporter assays using the ZEB1 3'-UTR, only miR-200b and both clusters were able to significantly reduce luciferase reporter expression, possibly reflecting the lower abundance of miR-200 sites in the ZEB1 3'-UTR fragment cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid.","Serum SNHG17 expression was negatively correlated with miR-375-3p expression, and miR-375-3p was the target miRNA of SNHG17."

"Western blot analysis showed that although c-Met expression was not affected by the transfection of a negative control, c-Met expression was dramatically reduced when transfected with either miR-1 or miR-206 (Fig.4E).",A similar effect on dopamine secretion also was observed.
Luciferase activity of wild-type (WT) or miR-199 mutant (199Mut) Ezh2 3'UTR construct was comparably reduced (Figure S2B).,"However, the involvement and molecular basis of CTGF in tumor progression and prognosis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have almost never been reported."
These data suggest that miR-199 has no significant role in Ezh2 3'UTR regulation.,"In this study, microarray profiling indicated that 13 miRNAs were differentially expressed in rat DRGs (L4-L6) during the initial 7d period post sciatic nerve transection, and that the expressions of miR-21 and miR-222 (2 out of the 13 miRNAs) were continually increased over the time period."
"Cells expressing miR-214-WT, but not miR-214-Mut, further suppressed the luciferase activity of WT, but not 214Mut, construct (Figure 2C).","The mineralized nodules formation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Runx2, OCN, OPN expressions were used as specific markers for the differentiation of osteoblasts."

The basis of this activity is the high degree of sequence homology between the seed sequence of miR-125a and the 30-UTR of p53.,"MicroRNAs(miR) play an important role in cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, which can function either as oncogenes or as tumor suppressors in their effect on tumor growth."

"By cotransfection of the reporter plasmids and internal control pRL-TK-Renilla-luciferase plasmids with miR-146a mimics or inhibitors in HEK293 cells, we observed that miR-146a mimics markedly decreased the luciferase level whereas miR-146a inhibitors increased its level (Fig.4C).","The miR-423 precursor gene was further shown to be a target gene of NFE2, which induced miR-423-5p expression to repress the FAM3A-ATP-Akt pathway in cultured hepatocytes."
"Furthermore, transfection of miR-146a mimics decreased IRAK2 expression in macrophages at both the protein and mRNA levels, whereas miR-146a inhibitors increased IRAK2 expression (Fig.4, E and F), suggesting that IRAK2 expression could be inhibited by miR-146a via both translational inhibition and mRNA degradation.","Functional studies show that miR-221 and miR-222 prevent quiescence when elevated during growth factor deprivation and induce precocious S-phase entry, thereby triggering cell death."

"As shown in Fig.6B, cotransfection of wild-type luciferase construct (B7-H3-WT) with negative control (NC) miRNA only moderately reduced luciferase activity with respect to parental luciferase construct (Control), presumably due to the existence of low levels of endogenous miR-29 in HeLa cells.",MicroRNA (miR)-9 plays different roles in different cancer types.

"As shown in Figure 4C, MAZ expression was higher in GBMs and GSCs than in NBTs, and was higher in GSCs than in GBMs.","In tissues such as fibroblasts and fetal hearts, where IGF1 levels are high, we found either absent or significantly low miR-378 levels, suggesting an inverse relationship between these two factors."
This was similar to the increased MAZ expression in human GBM cell lines U87 and U251 (Figure 4D).,"Using a microRNA microarray analysis, we identified one miRNA in activated RA FLS, miR-19b, which was downregulated and predicted to target Tlr2 mRNA."

"As shown in Fig.3D, exogenous expression of miR-25 caused approximately 50% reduction of the luciferase activity with the wild-type 30UTR of FBXW7, whereas no obvious changes of luciferase activity was observed with the mutant 30UTR in response to the miRNA expression.",Overexpression of miR-199a and miR-125b inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis associated with the decrease of HIF-1Î± and VEGF expression in ovarian cancer cells.

Our data verified that miR-155 could interact with the 30UTR of MAPK13 and MAPK14 in the luciferase assay (Fig.3A).,Our results showed that over-expression of miR-26a-5p inhibited osteogenesis and that suppression of endogenous miR-26a-5p promoted osteogenesis.
The miR-155 mimics inhibited the expression of MAPK13 and MAPK14 at the mRNA (Fig.3B) and protein level (Fig.3C).,Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that NOB1 was targeted by miR-139-3p at the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of its mRNA sequence.
"To determine whether the negative regulatory effects miR-1470 exerted on c-jun expression were mediated through the binding of miR-1470 to the presumed sites in the 30-UTR of the c-jun mRNA, we fused part of the c-jun 30-UTR, which included the predicted miR-1470 binding sites, to the downstream of the luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig.6B).","OBJECTIVE: Diabetes remains a major risk factor for vascular complications that seem to persist even after achieving glycemic control, possibly due to ""metabolic memory."""

"To further demonstrate that TLR4 is the target of miR181c, we performed target site inhibition assays.","Previously, our studies uncovered a batch of abnormally expressed circRNAs in glioma tissue, among which circPARP4 was significantly upregulated with the top fold change."
We found that the mRNA level of TLR4 in the cells transfected with miR-181c was significantly lower than those in the control cells.,"Similar to miR-375 loss-of-function studies, inhibition of Ago2 in the pancreatic Î²-cell resulted in enhanced insulin release underlining the relationship between these two genes."

"Further, the microRNA.org tool suggested that a few underexpressed validated miRNA, ie, miR-192, miR-34a, and let-7e aligned to the 30- UTR of these genes (Fig.8C)",Recently accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) may regulate diverse biological processes and may be important in tumorigenesis.

"Cotransfection of pre-miR-152 and XIST-Wt strongly decreased the luciferase activity, while co-transfection of pre-miR-152-NC and XISTWt did not change the luciferase activity, suggesting that XIST was a target of miR-152.","In the heart, specific expression was observed in cardiac myocytes, which was inducible by a variety of stressors."
"In parallel,we constructed the reporter plasmid that the miR-152 seed region binding site was mutated (XIST-Mut) to test the binding specificity.",Cellular apoptosis and the ceRNA network were validated.
