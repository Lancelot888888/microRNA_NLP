"In a luciferase assay in which the 3 -UTRs of SOD1 and SOD2 were included in  the  pGL3R  vector,  miR-377,  but  not  miR-143  as control,    considerably    reduced    luciferase    activity (Fig.4A)","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have previously been associated with cancer progression and sensitivity to chemotherapy; therefore, the present study aimed to identify miRNAs that may influence the sensitivity of human gastric cancer cells to cisplatin (DDP) treatment."

The luciferase activity assays at 24 hours post transfection demonstrated that miR-34a suppressed luciferase reporter activity by 50% (Figure 3c),The miR-199a-5p/SIRT1 pathway may thus represent a potential target for the prevention and treatment of epilepsy and epileptic damage.
"As expected, this suppression was abolished by deleting part of the perfectly complementary sequences in the BCL2 3`-UTR  (pGL3-mutBcl2-30UTR)  which  disrupts  the  interaction between miR-15b/miR-16 and BCL2 (Fig.3d).","Accordingly, the analysis of neoplastic and matched normal lung tissues reveals that miR-206 downregulation in lung tumors correlates, in most cases, with higher cyclin D1 levels."

"In cells treated with a miR-205 mimic, we found a marked reduction ( 50%) in luciferase activity [Fig.1 C and D and supporting information (SI) Fig.S1B]; however, no reduction in luciferase activity was seen in transfectants expressing miR-184 (Fig.S1A and Fig.1D), suggesting that miR-184 does not inhibit SHIP2.",We have developed an algorithm for predicting targets that does not rely on evolutionary conservation.
"To confirm this result, we mutated the miR-205 binding site on SHIP2 3 `UTR (Fig.1B, SHIP2 mut1).","Mechanically, LINC00461 was confirmed to sponge miR-216a to affect AQP4 expression."

"In addition, to validate whether RECK is a direct target of miR-21, we mutated the miR-21 binding site in the 3`UTR of RECK (in the reporter plasmid) and observed loss of repression (Figure 7d and e).","Furthermore, we discovered Myc as a key target of KDM2B that controls metabolic switch in GC."
These results all indicate RECK is a direct target of miR-21.,"Further experiments showed that miR-155 and BIC, the gene that encodes miR-155, were induced as early as four hours post-infection in primary human monocytes."
"Transfections with mimics for miR-186 and for miR-150 decreased  Fluc/Rluc  activity  by  20  and  27%,  respectively, whereas transfections with mimics for miR-186 plus miR-150 decreased Fluc/Rluc activity by 32% (p   0.01 compared with control, Fig.8B).",A positive staining of miR-21 was observed in 15 of 17 IDC cases.

"As shown in Figure 5B, mir-21 suppressed the luciferase activity of the Luc-PDCD4 3`-UTR by more than 50% compared with the vector control,whereas deletion of the mir-21 binding site (underlined in Figure 5A) blocked this suppression (Figure 5B).",The decreased levels in the circulation may reflect decreased vascular release but more studies are needed to confirm this relationship.
"Similarly, mir-21 also suppressed the luciferase activity of the LucMaspin 3`-UTR by more than 40% compared with the vector control (Figure 5B), and deletion of the mir-21 binding site (underlined) reversed this suppression.",Here we found that iron deficiency as well as hypoxia promoted microRNA-210 (miR-210) expression.
"Thus, miR-21 down-regulates PDCD4 at the translational level in T98G glioblastoma cell line.","miRNA always mediates target mRNA degradation or translation repression modestly; thus, the net effect of miR-466l's binding to IL-10 AU-rich elements is to prevent IL-10 mRNA degradation mediated by tristetraprolin, resulting in extended t(1/2) of IL-10 mRNA and elevated IL-10 expression."
"From this, we conclude that the miR-130a consensus binding sequences in the GAX 3'UTR mediate the down-regulation of GAX by mitogens and proangiogenic factors.","The cellular pathways that attenuate hepatic ER stress have been the focus of many recent studies, but the role of microRNAs (miRNA) in this process remains unknown."

"This region is evolutionary conserved and present in the Dnmt3b splice variants Dnmt3b1, Dnmt3b2, and Dnmt3b4, but not in the abundantly expressed Dnmt3b3.",A possible role for miRNA editing in altering the lung mRNA target repertoire was also identified.
"the expression of miR-148a affects the mRNA stability of Dnmt3b1, but not Dnmt3b3, leading to a relative increase in the abundance of Dnmt3b3 compared with Dnmt3b1 and all other Dnmt3b splice variants that express the targeted site.","To identify specific targets, we used bioinformatics analysis to predict whether miR-636 targets the 3'-UTR mRNA regions of IL1R1 and RANK (two pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors), IKBKB (a major protein in the NF-κB pathway), and FAM13A (a modifier gene of CF lung phenotype implicated in epithelial remodelling)."

"mRNA destabilization involving fast poly(A) removal was likewise observed for an element derived from MKK7 (MAPK kinase 7) mRNA, another message downregulated by miR-125b in P19 cells (Fig.2B; see also Fig.9, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).","In conclusion, our data revealed that miR-126 functions as a tumor suppressor in CRC cells by regulating CXCR4 expression via the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and might be a novel target for therapeutic strategies in CRC."
These findings indicate that miR-125b can expedite the deadenylation and decay of many different mRNAs bearing a variety of elements to which it is imperfectly complementary.,"Near the end of neural development, most asymmetric division ends and precursors differentiate."
"Besides lin-28, the P19 messages down-regulated by miR- 125b included Ajuba mRNA, whose 3' UTR contains a likely miR-125b-responsive element in both mice and humans (A1; Fig.2B).","We examined the role of miRNAs, particularly in the regulation of GLUT4, the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, in the AT of PCOS and matched control subjects."
"This reduction in mRNA was a consequence of accelerated deadenylation and decay, as evidenced by the ability of one copy of L7 to cause rapid poly(A) shortening and subsequent degradation of BG+L7 mRNA in 293T cells transfected with a gene encoding let-7a (Fig.3C; see also Fig.6).",We constructed a transgenic UAS-miRNA library in Drosophila melanogaster that contains 180 fly miRNAs.
"That these effects were not cell-type-specific and could be caused by an endogenous miRNA was demonstrated by showing a similar influence of L7 on mRNA deadenylation and decay in HeLa cells (Fig.3D), which produce let-7 naturally.","In conclusion, our data demonstrated that miR-513a-3p can sensitize human lung adenocarcinoma cells to cisplatin by targeting GSTP1."
"A second miRNA, let-7, also helps to down-regulate lin-28 gene expression in differentiating P19 cells by interacting with a distinct 3' UTR element (L7; Fig.3A).",Macroautophagy (autophagy) is the major intracellular degradation pathway for long-lived proteins and organelles.
Here we report the identification of human lin-28 mRNA as a regulatory target of human miR-125b and its homolog miR-125a.,The ABA and IAA related factors were differentially expressed in the mutants.
"Studies of miR-125b function in mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells induced to develop into neurons suggest a role for this regulatory miRNA in mammalian neuronal differentiation, since its increased concentration in these cells contributes to lin-28 downregulation.","Here, we report that miR-138 is commonly underexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) specimens and NPC cell lines."
"Whatever modest responsiveness remained in the reporter lacking both miRE1 and miRE2 was abolished when a third, weaker element (miRE0) (Fig.3) was removed as well (because of its minimal efficacy, deleting miRE0 alone from the lin-28 3'UTR had little influence on repression).",How progranulin (PGRN) expression is regulated is largely unknown.
"Thus, miRE1 and miRE2 appear to be the principal elements within the human lin-28 3'UTR that mediate repression by miR-125a and miR-125b, and both are necessary for efficient downregulation.","More importantly, we found that miR-31-knockdown ASCs dramatically improved the repair of CSDs, including increased bone volume, increased bone mineral density (BMD) and decreased scaffold residue in vivo."
Additional experiments showed that miRE1 and miRE2 are alone sufficient to direct repression by miR-125a and miR-125b when each is inserted in multiple copies into another luciferase reporter bearing a 3'UTR derived from SV40.,"Furthermore, the levels of Dicer inversely correlate with PMP22, while the inhibition of Dicer leads to elevated PMP22."
"By contrast, inserting multiple copies of other lin-28 3'UTR elements with the potential to form thermodynamically favorable duplexes with miR-125a and miR-125b (element X or element Y) had no such effect, and insertion of miRE0 alone had only a small effect (Fig.2C and 3).","These results indicate new strategies for probing autonomic circulatory control and ultimately, susceptibility to hypertensive renal sequelae."
"The repressive influence of miRE1 and miRE2 on reporter gene expression was also observed in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which naturally produce miR-125b at a concentration similar to that in transfected 293T cells (data not shown).",Thirty-five miRNAs were identified.
"In mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells induced to differentiate into neurons, a marked increase in miR-125b abundance helps to downregulate lin-28 gene expression.","miR-138 represses expression of both BCR-ABL and CCND3 via binding to the coding region and 3'-UTR, respectively."
That miR-125b in particular likely contributes to lin-28 repression during differentiation of P19 cells was implied by experiments showing that this miRNA is able to downregulate expression of the endogenous lin-28 gene in undifferentiated P19 cells engineered to produce miR-125b at a physiological concentration.,"Here, we investigated the effect of miR-145 on osteogenic differentiation."
"This study shows that oncogenic microRNA, miR-21, represses RHOB expression by directly targeting the 3' untranslated region.","Moreover, up-regulated of PTCH1 could attenuate the effect induced by miR-212."
"Collectively, our data demonstrate that the impairment of miR24 and miR93 production caused by Dicer1 deficiency is the major cause of the observed increase in susceptibility to VSV in Dicer1d/d mice.","In particular, down-regulation of hsa-let-7c was observed in BL cases, compared to normal controls."
"We found that host miR24 and miR93 could target viral large protein (L protein) and phosphoprotein (P protein) genes, and a lack of miR24 and miR93 was responsible for increased VSV replication in Dicer1d/d cells.","Here, we extended our search for target genes and identified MKK7, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, as a novel target of miR-493."
We then showed that miR-29a negatively regulated collagen IV by directly targeting the 3'UTRs of col4a1 and col4a2.,"Specifically, we identify miR-125b and miR-326 as suppressors of the pathway activator Smoothened together with miR-324-5p, which also targets the downstream transcription factor Gli1."
"Consistent with the results of the reporter assay, the virus titer was approximately five and four times greater in the anti-miR24- and anti-miR93-treated cells, respectively (Figure 5E), whereas anti-miR146 and antimiR378 only had a modest effect on VSV replication in macrophages (Figure 5E).","Although recent studies have shown the important role of miR-125b in several tumors and overexpression of miR-125b in advanced EC, its function in this disease has not yet been defined."
"Although no changes in EGFP fluorescence were observed for the EGFP and EGFP-2 or 3X MREs of lmo2, alas2, and klf12 (Figure S8A,C-E), a dramatic suppression of EGFP expression was obtained in the embryos injected with control EGFP-2X PT and EGFP-2X MRE-klfd mRNAs (Figure S8B,F), suggesting that the MRE of klfd 3'-UTR can be efficiently targeted by miR-144.",Vertebrate multiciliated cells (MCCs) contribute to fluid propulsion in several biological processes.
"Indeed, we have confirmed that miR-107 targets NF1-A",Forced down-expression of miR-34c-5p decreased the expression of UVB-SIPS induced P21 and P53 at both mRNA and protein levels.
"Interestingly, we found that miR-107, which is predicted to target NFI-A, (Figure 4a) was upregulated as well after ATRA treatment (Figure 2d).","Lastly, miR-27b through PPARγ regulates nuclear factor-κB activity and transcription of inflammatory target genes."
"To confirm a direct interaction between these two genes, we cloned the NFI-A 3' untranslated region (UTRs) predicted to interact with miR-107 into a pGL3 luciferase reporter vector.","We also assessed the body weight, fat mass and the content of serum lipid in rats subcutaneous injected with BPA and miR-21a-5p mimics."
"When the miR-107 precursor oligonucleotide was transfected into the NB4 cells along with the reporter plasmid containing the NFI-A 3'UTR sequence by nucleoporation, a 40% reduction of normalized luciferase activity was observed compared with the control scrambled oligonucleotide (Figure 4b)","Like other cancers, aberrant gene regulation features significantly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)."

"We further show that miR-224 can inhibit cell invasion and directly targets CDC42 and CXCR4, and that suppression of CDC42 and CXCR4 by RNAi causes inhibition of Ubc9-mediated invasion.","Additionally, Hnf-3β, a liver enriched transcription factor that activates miR-122 gene, was suppressed in c-MYC-induced tumors."

"Similarly, forced expression of full-length notch3 largely rescued the repressive effect of miR-206 on human notch3 3'-UTR-lucif- erase activity (Fig.2A, left).","Conversely, overexpression of miR-33b impaired preadipocyte proliferation and reduced lipid droplet formation and the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) target genes during differentiation."
"When the cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of miR-206, the repression of the human notch3 3'-UTR by miR-206 was moderately released (Fig.2B, left), suggesting that a higher dose of the miR-206 inhibitor would be required to efficiently block the inhibitory effect of miR-206 on the activity of the human notch3 3'-UTR.","MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) is downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the underlying mechanisms by which it suppresses tumorigenesis in NSCLC are largely unknown."
"As expected, ectopic expression of miR-206 resulted in a significant reduction of human Notch3 protein expression (Fig.2C and supplemental Fig.S3A).",ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent a large group of efflux pumps that are strongly involved in the pharmacokinetics of various drugs and nutrient distribution.
"In addition, the level of human notch3 mRNA was also repressed by miR-206 (Fig.2D)","Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-30e suppresses cell growth, which can be partially reversed by Ubc9."
miR-206 targets and regulates mouse notch3.,The candidate miRNA target was identified by in silico analysis and its expression documented in the diabetic kidney associated with fibrotic markers.
Cotransfection of cells with the parental luciferase construct (without the notch3 3'-UTR) plus the miR-206 expression plasmid did not change the expression of the reporter (data not shown).,"In particular, PML/RARα-positive blasts from APL patients display lower levels of miRNA let-7c, a member of the let-7 family, than normal promyelocytes and its expression increases after ATRA treatment."
"However, miR-206 dose-dependently decreased the luciferase activity when cotransfected with the mouse notch3 3'-UTR containing the miR-206 target site (Fig.1B, left).","We also found that transfection with precursor miR-10b into gastric cancer cells dramatically decreased MAPRE1 mRNA and protein, resulting in a significant decrease in colony formation and cell growth rates."
"The inhibitory effect of miR-206 on mouse notch3 3'-UTR activity was partially rescued by coexpression of a full-length notch3 plasmid, suggesting that notch3 was effective in inhibiting the ability of miR-206 to inhibit the expression of the reporter gene containing the miR-206-binding site.","In addition, sustained suppression of SIRT7 reduced the in vivo tumor growth rate in a mouse xenograft model."
"In addition, suppression of the notch3 3'-UTR by miR-206 was relieved by deletion (Fig.1B, right) or mutation (supplemental Fig.S2A) of the miR-206-binding site and was markedly recovered by a specific miR-206 inhibitor (Fig.1C) whose function is to block the cleavage of precursor miR-206 to mature miR-206 (21).",BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) is a known proto-oncogene.
"Furthermore, overexpression of miR-206 markedly decreased the levels of endogenous mouse Notch3 protein (Fig.1D) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas cel-miR-64 had no effect on mouse Notch33 protein expression.",The target genes of miR-130a-3p and the associated signalling pathways were identified using bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification of the interactions between the target predicted by the algorithms and dysregulated mRNAs.
"Co-transfection of the reporter plasmid along with miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-429, as well as each or both of the clusters in 4TO7 cells, resulted in a significantly reduced ZEB2-3'-UTR-luciferase expression, suggesting that these miRNAs are likely to target ZEB2 directly (Fig.2D, left panel).","We investigated in detail one miRNA, miR-24, and found that it is a novel regulator of Oxt and controls both transcript and peptide levels of Oxt."
"In reporter assays using the ZEB1 3'-UTR, only miR-200b and both clusters were able to significantly reduce luciferase reporter expression, possibly reflecting the lower abundance of miR-200 sites in the ZEB1 3'-UTR fragment cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid.","Serum SNHG17 expression was negatively correlated with miR-375-3p expression, and miR-375-3p was the target miRNA of SNHG17."
"In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that miR-1285 directly regulates the expression of p53 by directly targeting its 3' UTR.","Knockdown of GAB1/SHC1 or CDK2 phenocopied the apoptotic or cell cycle arrest-inducing function of miR-5582-5p, respectively."

"Western blot analysis showed that although c-Met expression was not affected by the transfection of a negative control, c-Met expression was dramatically reduced when transfected with either miR-1 or miR-206 (Fig.4E).",A similar effect on dopamine secretion also was observed.
Luciferase activity of wild-type (WT) or miR-199 mutant (199Mut) Ezh2 3'UTR construct was comparably reduced (Figure S2B).,"However, the involvement and molecular basis of CTGF in tumor progression and prognosis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have almost never been reported."
These data suggest that miR-199 has no significant role in Ezh2 3'UTR regulation.,"In this study, microarray profiling indicated that 13 miRNAs were differentially expressed in rat DRGs (L4-L6) during the initial 7d period post sciatic nerve transection, and that the expressions of miR-21 and miR-222 (2 out of the 13 miRNAs) were continually increased over the time period."
"Cells expressing miR-214-WT, but not miR-214-Mut, further suppressed the luciferase activity of WT, but not 214Mut, construct (Figure 2C).","The mineralized nodules formation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Runx2, OCN, OPN expressions were used as specific markers for the differentiation of osteoblasts."
"Overall, these results are consistent with a direct targeting of Ezh2 3'UTR by miR-214.","In vitro, overexpressing miR-130b suppressed signaling downstream from the type I IFN pathway in RMCs by targeting IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1)."
"As predicted, the expression of TRAF6 and IRAK1, two known miR-146a targets, were decreased in macrophages transfected with miR-146a, as compared with that of control cells; and inhibition of miR-146a enhanced the expression of TRAF6 and IRAK-1 (Fig.4A).","Upon modulation of the miR-23a cluster by the respective miRNA antagomirs and mimics, we observed significant changes in IFN-γ expression, but only slight effects on CD107a/LAMP1 expression."
"Here, we show that an additional isomer of miRNA-125 (miRNA-125a) translationally arrests mRNA of the p53 tumor suppressor gene.","Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally linked to several acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related malignancies, including Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and a subset of multicentric Castleman's disease."
The basis of this activity is the high degree of sequence homology between the seed sequence of miR-125a and the 30-UTR of p53.,"MicroRNAs(miR) play an important role in cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, which can function either as oncogenes or as tumor suppressors in their effect on tumor growth."

"By cotransfection of the reporter plasmids and internal control pRL-TK-Renilla-luciferase plasmids with miR-146a mimics or inhibitors in HEK293 cells, we observed that miR-146a mimics markedly decreased the luciferase level whereas miR-146a inhibitors increased its level (Fig.4C).","The miR-423 precursor gene was further shown to be a target gene of NFE2, which induced miR-423-5p expression to repress the FAM3A-ATP-Akt pathway in cultured hepatocytes."
"Furthermore, transfection of miR-146a mimics decreased IRAK2 expression in macrophages at both the protein and mRNA levels, whereas miR-146a inhibitors increased IRAK2 expression (Fig.4, E and F), suggesting that IRAK2 expression could be inhibited by miR-146a via both translational inhibition and mRNA degradation.","Functional studies show that miR-221 and miR-222 prevent quiescence when elevated during growth factor deprivation and induce precocious S-phase entry, thereby triggering cell death."
E2F1 Is a Target of miR-106b and miR-93.,"MiRNA-mediated down-regulation of PRDM1/Blimp-1 may contribute to the phenotype maintenance and pathogenesis of HRS cells by interfering with normal B-cell terminal differentiation, thus representing a novel molecular lesion, as well as a potential therapeutic target in HL."

"As shown in Fig.6B, cotransfection of wild-type luciferase construct (B7-H3-WT) with negative control (NC) miRNA only moderately reduced luciferase activity with respect to parental luciferase construct (Control), presumably due to the existence of low levels of endogenous miR-29 in HeLa cells.",MicroRNA (miR)-9 plays different roles in different cancer types.

"B7-H3 mRNA level was not affected (data not shown), suggesting that modulation of B7-H3 protein levels by miR-29a was primarily due to repressed translation, and not mRNA degradation.","Here, we link the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT4 with cellular senescence, skin aging, and mitochondrial dysfunction."

"This showed significant decrease in luciferase activity for miR-20a, miR-92a and miR- 181a indicating a direct interaction between these miRNAs and the 39UTR of RGS5 (Figure 2A).","Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Aβ-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue."
We observed DNMT1 was significantly reduced at both the mRNA and protein level transfected with miR- 152 or miR-185 mimic compared with the NC group in SKOV3/ DDP cells (Figures 4b and c).,"Interestingly, miR-192 appeared to target Atp1b1 through the 5'-, rather than 3'-untranslated region."

"To demonstrate the physiological significance of miR-320a in human B cells, we studied whether decreased expression of endogenous miR- 320a is mechanistically linked to increased expression of its proinflammatory target molecule MMP-9.",These results also illustrate a novel function of miR-16 targeting ARL2 in modulating proliferation and cell cycle progression.
B cells from healthy donors were transfected with specific inhibitor to miR-320a (anti-miR-320a) or negative control miRNA inhibitor (anti-miR control) followed by analysis of MMP-9 protein expression in cells and its secretion in the culture medium.,"Among the most strongly predicted targets of miR-486 are phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and Foxo1a, which negatively affect phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling."

"Luciferase activity was repressed when the construct (Luc-Par4) was co-transfected with miR-17-3p mimic, and the repression was abolished when the target site was mutated, thus confirming direct targeting of Par4 by miR-17-3p (Fig.3B)","Introduction of hsa-miR-520h mimics into PANC-1 cells also resulted in inhibition of cell migration and invasion, and reduction of side population cells."
Computational analysis indicated that WNT5A is a potential hsa-miR- 516a-3p target because its 30-UTR is matched to the hsa-miR-516a- 3p seed region (Fig.5A).,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate various cellular processes; however, their role in liver fibrosis is unclear."

This prompted us to study the expression of BMI1 in ectopic miR-124 expressed cells revealing a significant down-regulation (Fig.2C).,The appearance of a germinal center phenotype in EBV-positive cells might thus derive from a block in B-cell differentiation.
These results suggesting that BMI1 was indeed a direct downstream functional target of miR-203.,"Moreover, in gastric cancer tissues, we observed an inverse correlation between miR-148a and ROCK1 expression."

"We found that Smad5 significantly accumulated on miRNA suppression, whereas we did not find any alterations of Smad4 protein levels (Figure 6b), indicating that Smad5 is a direct target of the miRNAs of 23a and 23b clusters in ESCs.","Focusing on target genes of HOX-C8, which might play an important role in melanomagenesis, we identified three genes (cadherin-11, calponin-1 and osteopontin) that are up- or down-regulated, respectively, by altered HOX-C8 expression in miR-196a expressing cell clones and are thus indirectly regulated by this microRNA."
"To further assess whether these regulators of cell cycle and survival are potential targets of miR-143 or miR-145, we transfected mimics of these miRNAs into HCA-7 cells (IRS-1) or HT-29 cells (K-RAS, API5, and ERK5) and examined their effects on these proteins.","miR-124 exerted its effects by targeting multiple genes, including a known component of the NFAT pathway, NFATc1, and two new regulators of NFAT signaling, CAMTA1 (calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1) and PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1)."
"As shown in Fig.6, transfected miR-145 or miR-143 downregulated IRS-1 (miR- 145), K-RAS (miR-143), and ERK5 (miR-143), respectively.","To address this question, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression during serum stimulation of quiescent human cells."
"In contrast, no differences were seen in expression of API5 with transfection of miR-143 (Fig.6).","The oncosuppressor activity of miR-340 has been recently characterized in breast, colorectal and osteosarcoma tumor cells."
We then constructed a luciferase reporter that contained the TYMS 3'UTR downstream of the luciferase coding gene.,"Finally, in situ hybridization showed that miR-203 expression is attenuated in colon tumour tissues compared to normal colon tissues, suggesting that miR-203 could be a potential new prognostic marker and therapeutic target to explore in colon cancer."

"As shown in Fig.4B, we found that LoVo cells with miR-203 ASO had a higher level of TYMS 3'UTR intensity than the control cells, while Caco2 cells with miR-203 mimics had a lower intensity.","Here, we investigated the mechanism through which governs the post-transcriptional regulation of Bub1 protein expression level."
"However, neither miR-203 ASO nor miR-203 mimics affected the intensity of mutant TYMS 3'UTR (Fig.4B).",Introduction of FOXO3a cDNA lacking the 3'-untranslated region abrogates miR-155-induced cell survival and chemoresistance.
The luciferase assay suggests that miR-203 suppresses TYMS expression via binding to its 3'UTR.,"microRNAs, a family of small non-coding RNAs, regulating approximately 30% of all human genes are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of several types of cancers, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC)."

"We found that over-expression of miR-449a decreased the mRNA and protein expression of MAZ, whereas inhibition of miR-449a increased the mRNA and protein expression of MAZ in U87, U251 and GSCs (Figure 4A and B).","To reveal this, we detected the expression profiles of miR-15a/b during adipogenesis in porcine pre-adipocyte, and found that their expression levels increased in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation and dropped after day 4."
These results indicated that miR-449a could inhibit MAZ expression in human GBM cell lines and GSCs.,"In addition, Bcl-2 was identified as one of the direct targets of miR-205 in LSCC cells."
"As shown in Figure 4C, MAZ expression was higher in GBMs and GSCs than in NBTs, and was higher in GSCs than in GBMs.","In tissues such as fibroblasts and fetal hearts, where IGF1 levels are high, we found either absent or significantly low miR-378 levels, suggesting an inverse relationship between these two factors."
This was similar to the increased MAZ expression in human GBM cell lines U87 and U251 (Figure 4D).,"Using a microRNA microarray analysis, we identified one miRNA in activated RA FLS, miR-19b, which was downregulated and predicted to target Tlr2 mRNA."

"Notably, our results revealed that miR-27b significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of reporter genes containing 30-UTR of CRISP2 compared with the controls (Fig.3C), indicating that CRISP2 was a miR-27b target and miR-27b might be involved in asthenozoospermia by directly suppressing CRISP2.","Inflammation in the microenvironment resulted in an inhibition of miR-17 levels, and a perturbation in the expression of miR-17 partly reversed the differentiation potential of PDLSCs in this microenvironment."
"To confirm that miR-200b directly targets WASF3, the full length and two fragments of WASF3 3'UTR containing miR-200b binding siteswere separately cloned into the downstream of a luciferase reporter gene to construct plasmids pGL3-W, pGL3-W-1 and pGL3-W-2.","In nature, animals often face feast or famine conditions."

"To determine whether miR-25 can regulate FBXW7 expression through its likely target in its 30UTR region, we generated a reporter construct where coding sequence for firefly luciferase was followed by a 30UTR sequence of FBXW7, or by a mutant 30UTR sequence of FBXW7 where the target sequences of miR- 25 were destroyed.",The aim of this study was to investigate TAM-mediated regulation of Bmi1 expression in gastrointestinal cancer.
"As shown in Fig.3D, exogenous expression of miR-25 caused approximately 50% reduction of the luciferase activity with the wild-type 30UTR of FBXW7, whereas no obvious changes of luciferase activity was observed with the mutant 30UTR in response to the miRNA expression.",Overexpression of miR-199a and miR-125b inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis associated with the decrease of HIF-1α and VEGF expression in ovarian cancer cells.

"Additionally, bioinformatics prediction along with biochemical assay results clearly suggested that the secretory small GTPase Rab27B and serine racemase (SRR) were direct targets of miR-193a-3p and miR-193a-5p, respectively.",Knockdown of p65 also induced miR-29c expression but had no effect on COL3A1 expression.
"Since miR-24 has been reported to be able to down-regulate c-Myc by binding to its seedless 30 UTR in human cells (Lal et al, 2009), the reporter harboring the entire 30 UTR of c-Myc was also engineered.",Decreased miR-302b and increased CDK2 expressions can significantly promote proliferation and G1/S phase transformation in gastric cancer.

"The luciferase activity of a construct containing the 132-154 binding site is decreased by miR-148a-3p cotransfection, demonstrating that this site is directly targeted by miR-148a-3p.","Further, we discovered that attenuated CTGF-mediated upregulation of miR-18b was dependent on the increased binding of transcription factors Jun proto-oncogene (C-Jun) and v-Myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (C-Myc) to miR-18b promoter region via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway."
"The sequence specificity of the targeting of the 132-154 site is further confirmed by disruption of 3 bases within the seed binding site (bases 147-154), resulting in abrogation of miR-148a-3p repression.","Deleting the LCE produces a dominant gain-of-function allele that causes a retarded phenotype, indicating that lin-28 activity is a switch that controls choices of stage-specific fates."
